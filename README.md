# In this project I work on images to classify tissues of a zebrafish. The project involves eliminating noise in image, focussing on the region of interest, extracting features from the region of interest,
training a classifier based on those features and then testing the classifier. I plan to experiment with different classifiers and mathematical models in this entire project
